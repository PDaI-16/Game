## Game

## Map and Levels  
- 2D roguelike game with procedurally generated levels, meaning every level is different.  
- Infinite number of levels, allowing you to keep playing as long as you can survive.  
- To move between levels, defeat the boss of the current level, after which you will teleport to the next level.


## Weapons  
- Each weapon is randomly selected from a set of weapon sprites, with fully randomized stats.  
- There are three types of weapons: Melee, Ranged, and Magic.
- Weapons have five different raritites which are color coded (grey, green, blue, red and golden)


## Hats  
- Hats are generated similarly to weapons but provide the player with passive boosts.
- Player only gets the added damage and attackspeed from the hat if equipped weapon is the same category.
- Hats have five different raritites which are color coded (grey, green, blue, red and golden)


## Player  
- The player can unlock various skill enhancements from the skill tree, which is divided into branches for Melee, Ranged, and Magic.  
- The player is not limited to a single branch; they can explore other branches if they find high-level items that don't fit their current build.  
- Example: If the player finds a powerful mage hat during gameplay, they may want to start investing in the Magic branch, even if they initially focused on Melee or Ranged.  
- Similarly, discovering a high-level ranged weapon would likely prompt the player to invest in the Ranged tree.


## Basic Enemies  
- Enemies are randomly generated and they can be of type melee or ranged.


## Bosses  
- Each level has one boss, which is a larger and stronger version of a randomly selected enemy.  
- Bosses too can be of type melee or ranged, but they can also spawn minions etc.
